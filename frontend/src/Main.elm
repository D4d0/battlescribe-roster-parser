## How To Use
        
This website is designed to be used with the in-game tool for Tabletop Simulator provided 
[here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1793303279). This tool helps with 
importing Warhammer 40k rosters created in the [Battlescribe](https://battlescribe.net/) army builder tool into TTS.

To use this tool first create a roster with [Battlescribe](https://battlescribe.net/) and save 
the roster file (the file created should have the .rosz extension). Use the button above to upload 
the .rosz file. When the roster is uploaded, you'll be provided a code - copy this to your clipboard. 
Your code will remain valid for 1 hour

In Tabletop Simulator, paste the code into the Battlescribe2TTS tool and then click "Submit Code". A series of buttons 
will be created corresponding to the various selections in your army. To tell the tool which in-game model to 
use for a particular selection, first click the button, then pick up the model you want to use. The button should change 
colors to indicate the model has been saved.

Once all models have been selected, click the "Create Army" button. The models for your army will be 
spawned into the game, organized by unit, with their names and descriptions filled in from your Battlescribe data. 
You're ready to play!

An example roster created using this tool:

![Example Roster](assets/example-roster.png "Example Roster")


## Saved Models

When you select a model with the Battlescribe2TTS tool, the model you've selected is saved 
into the tool. You can avoid having to re-select models for similar armies in the future by 
adding the tool to your "Saved Objects" after selecting models. Your selections will be saved 
and automatically populated in the future for matching units

## Reporting Issues

If you have issues trying to use this tool, please create an issue on 
[github](https://github.com/pwestling/battlescribe-roster-parser/issues). Please note that 
none of this is supported by the Battlescribe or Tabletop Simulator teams in any way, so don't complain to them!
